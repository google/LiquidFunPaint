LiquidFun Paint is a creative application created to demonstrate the use of
LiquidFun, an open source technology that provides developers with a liquid
particle system and physics simulation.

You can find out more about LiquidFun at http://google.github.io/liquidfun/.

LiquidFun Paint lets users create with three drawing tools:

*   The liquid paint tool lets you fill up a scene with multicolored fluids that
flow, drip and slosh realistically.

*   The sticky paint tool lets you draw images that will not move or be affected
by fluids.

*   The dry paint tool lets you draw objects that will float, bob, and move with
the fluid.

Start playing and see what you can create!
